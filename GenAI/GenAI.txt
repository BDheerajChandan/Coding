- AI is combination o ML and Computer vision
- Gen AI includes LLM and NLP
- Example of LLM is GPT(Generative PreTrained Transformer)
- LLM is a subpart of GenAI and GenAI is subpart of AI
- AI works using Neuaral Network [ANN], where input layers is given to relu then sigmoid and finally output.
- Unsupervised Generative Pretraining : Training a model to learn useful representation of data without abelling training. 	Like GPT
- Reinforcement Learning : Learns to make decisions by performing actions and recieving feedback
	Like Learning to play by recieving +/i rewards
- GenAI model types : Text to [Text,Image,Audio,Video] and Image to image
- Multimodel model : Text,Image,Audio,Video to Text,Image,Audio,Video
- Combination of Human and AI product like ChatBot,CoPiolet is AIModel like ChatGPT
- Example of LLM is GPT which generates text based examples
- LLM are type of GenAI and GenAI is a subset of broader field of AI

- Types of AI : NonGenAI and GenAI
- Non GenAI are Unsupervised model and GenA are models that created own new content
- Statistical NL -> Neural Network -> Recurrent Neural Network -> Transformers
- Language Models is a AI model which predicts next word or words for a given sequence of words by Neural Network.
- RLHF :
- Deep Learning : Supervised [AN, CNN, RNN]
		  UnSupervised [Recommendation Systems, AutoEncoders, SOM]
- Transformers : Text to Text [BERT, GPT]
		 Text to Image [DALL-E , Stable Diffusion]
		 Text to Video [OpenAI Sora]
- Embedding : Numerical representation of text in form of a vector
  Vector database embedding : Allows to store these embedding and perform efficient search on these embeddings.
- Symmetric search :
- Query vector go under Cosine simulation -> vectors -> Similar vectors
- LSH(Locality Sensitivity Hashing) - 
- Benefits of Vector Databases : Fast search and Optimized storage

- LangChain is a python framework used to build a GenAI applications that makes LLM apps easier
- Applications -> LangChain -> ChatGPT,Llama
- Tooling for GenAI : GPT4,Llma2, Mistral, Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, 
			Azure OpenAI, Amazon BedRock, 
			Langchain, Transformers, 
			Pytorch, Tensorflow
- Limitations : High cost, No access to internet , No access to private data source
- pip install langchain ; pip install OpenAI
- Simple Sequencial chain and Sequential chain
