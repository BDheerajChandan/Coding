- AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a broader field that includes various subfields like machine learning (ML), computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), robotics, etc. Computer vision is a subset of AI, but AI isn't limited to just ML and computer vision.


- Gen AI includes LLM and NLP
- Example of LLM is GPT(Generative PreTrained Transformer)
- LLM is a subpart of GenAI and GenAI is subpart of AI

- Unsupervised learning typically refers to learning from unlabeled data. GPT uses a form of pretraining called self-supervised learning, where it learns by predicting parts of the input data (e.g., the next word in a sentence). While this is related to unsupervised learning, it's not exactly the same, as self-supervised learning leverages labels generated from the data itself.


- Reinforcement Learning : Learns to make decisions by performing actions and recieving feedback
	Like Learning to play by recieving +/i rewards
- GenAI model types : Text to [Text,Image,Audio,Video] and Image to image
- Multimodel model : Text,Image,Audio,Video to Text,Image,Audio,Video


- Chatbots and copilots are products that combine AI with human interaction. ChatGPT is an example of a conversational AI model.


- Example of LLM is GPT which generates text based examples
- LLM are type of GenAI and GenAI is a subset of broader field of AI

===========================================================================================================================

- AI is generally categorized in terms of different approaches and techniques, like traditional AI (rule-based systems, expert systems) and modern AI (machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI).

- Generative AI (GenAI) refers specifically to AI models that create new content, like text, images, or videos, but non-generative AI is not a standard term. Instead, AI can be divided into various subfields like supervised/unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, etc., rather than just focusing on whether it's generative or not.

- Unsupervised models (such as clustering algorithms) are not necessarily non-generative AI. Generative AI refers specifically to models that create new content (like text, images, or music), and not all AI models fall into this category.


- Statistical NL -> Neural Network -> Recurrent Neural Network -> Transformers
This sequence broadly represents the evolution of AI models for natural language processing (NLP), but it's a simplification. The progression typically goes from statistical models (like n-grams) to neural networks (such as feedforward networks), then to RNNs (which handle sequences better), and finally to transformers, which have significantly improved performance in NLP tasks.


- Language Models is a AI model which predicts next word or words for a given sequence of words by Neural Network.


- RLHF : RLHF involves using reinforcement learning with human feedback to fine-tune models. It typically combines reinforcement learning and human-provided feedback to improve the model's performance and make it more aligned with human preferences.



- Deep Learning : Supervised [AN, CNN, RNN]
		  UnSupervised [Recommendation Systems, AutoEncoders, SOM]
- Transformers : Text to Text [BERT, GPT]
		 Text to Image [DALL-E , Stable Diffusion]
		 Text to Video [OpenAI Sora]
- Embedding : Numerical representation of text in form of a vector
  Vector database embedding : Allows to store these embedding and perform efficient search on these embeddings.
- Symmetric search :
- Query vector go under Cosine simulation -> vectors -> Similar vectors


- LSH(Locality Sensitivity Hashing) - LSH is a method for performing approximate nearest neighbor searches in high-dimensional data by hashing similar items into the same "bucket."



- Benefits of Vector Databases : Fast search and Optimized storage
