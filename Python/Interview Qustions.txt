1. What is Difference between List and Tuple ?
	List  - [], mutable, Data can be modified
	Tuple - (), immutable, Data cant be modified'

2. What are Python Features ?
	Interpreted Language
	Dynamically Typed
	High Level Language
	Cross-Platform
	Extensive Standard Library:

3. How to Optimize Python ?
	Use built-in functions and libraries:
	list comprehensions:
	Avoid global variables
	Use appropriate data structures
	Python's timeit module to test 

4. What is difference between Python 2and3 ?
	Python2 - print is a statement, xrange()
	Python3 - print is a function, range()

5. What are Generators ?
	Type of iterable used with yield keyword.
	Used to produce values lazily 
	Don't store the entire sequence in memory
	They generate values one at a time.
	Useful for handling large datasets or streams of data.

6. What are Decorators ?
	To modify add change functionality without editing a code
	To modify or enhance the behavior of functions or methods without modifying the actual code of the function.

7. What is List comprehension ?
	Simplest way to create a list using for loop.
	Concise and efficient way to create lists in Python
	It has expression, item, iterable, condition writtn in single line

8. what is shallow copy and deep copy ?
	Shallow copy and deep copy creates a new object reference.
	Shallow copy - When a data value is changed then orginal also changes.
		       New object copies references to Original objects.
	Deep copy - When a data value is changed then original remain unchanged.
		    Original object and the copy do not share any references.

9. What is OOPs ?
	OOPs - Object Oriented Programming
	Objects are instance of a class
	Object is an identificiable entity that has some features and behaviour.
	To get those features and behaviour we need to create an object reference.
	Primary principles of OOPs : Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism

10. What is abstraction ?
	Hiding implementation details from the user
	Exposing only the essential features.

11. What is encapsulation ?
	Wrapping up of a data into a single unit.
	Exposing only the essential features
 
12. What is Polymorphism and its types ?
	Polymorphism is a technique of modifying the existing functionality.
	It has 2 types - Method Overloading and Method Overriding
	Method Overloading - Same method name with different signatures
	Method Overriding - Same method name gets implemented by new functionality

13. What is inheritance ?
	Inheriting feature and behaviour of Parent class to Child class.

14. What is difference between '==' and 'is' ?
	'==' is a relational operator used to check equality of a vlaue. Compare the values of two objects.
	'is' is a key keyword used to check object reference location or two references point to the same object in memory. 

15. What is lambda function ? When to use filter,map,reduce ?
	It is a simplest form of representation of a anonymous function which takes any number of arguments and one exression
	filter is used to filter the results which contains elements belongs to true condition.
	map is used to get output value or entire results for expression. Returns an iterator of the results.
	reduce is used to reduce to the single valued output result. To reduce an iterable to a single value

16. What is main purpose of Python ?
	Readability, Ease of use, and developer productivity
	General-Purpose Programming
	Cross-Platform Compatibility
	Extensive Standard Library
	Rapid Prototyping and Development	
	Interpreted Language
	Integration and Extensibility

What is PEP8 and how it is useful ?
What are modules and packages ? Mention its uses and applications ?
What is Garbage collector ?
What is Memory leak and how to handle them ?
What is Static method and class method ?
What is __init__(), __str__(), __repr__() ?
what are Golbal varibles? Public, private, protected ?
What is difference between del and remove ?
