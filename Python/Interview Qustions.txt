1. What is Difference between List and Tuple ?
	List  - [], mutable, Data can be modified
	Tuple - (), immutable, Data cant be modified'

2. What are Python Features ?
	Interpreted Language
	Dynamically Typed
	High Level Language
	Cross-Platform
	Extensive Standard Library:

3. How to Optimize Python ?
	Use built-in functions and libraries:
	list comprehensions:
	Avoid global variables
	Use appropriate data structures
	Python's timeit module to test 

4. What is difference between Python 2and3 ?
	Python2 - print is a statement, xrange()
	Python3 - print is a function, range()

5. What are Generators ?
	Type of iterable used with yield keyword.
	Used to produce values lazily 
	Don't store the entire sequence in memory
	They generate values one at a time.
	Useful for handling large datasets or streams of data.

6. What are Decorators ?
	To modify add change functionality without editing a code
	To modify or enhance the behavior of functions or methods without modifying the actual code of the function.

7. What is List comprehension ?
	Simplest way to create a list using for loop.
	Concise and efficient way to create lists in Python
	It has expression, item, iterable, condition writtn in single line

8. what is shallow copy and deep copy ?
	Shallow copy and deep copy creates a new object reference.
	Shallow copy - When a data value is changed then orginal also changes.
		       New object copies references to Original objects.
	Deep copy - When a data value is changed then original remain unchanged.
		    Original object and the copy do not share any references.

9. What is OOPs ?
	OOPs - Object Oriented Programming
	Objects are instance of a class
	Object is an identificiable entity that has some features and behaviour.
	To get those features and behaviour we need to create an object reference.
	Primary principles of OOPs : Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism

10. What is abstraction ?
	Hiding implementation details from the user
	Exposing only the essential features.

11. What is encapsulation ?
	Wrapping up of a data into a single unit.
	Exposing only the essential features
 
12. What is Polymorphism and its types ?
	Polymorphism is a technique of modifying the existing functionality.
	It has 2 types - Method Overloading and Method Overriding
	Method Overloading - Same method name with different signatures
	Method Overriding - Same method name gets implemented by new functionality

13. What is inheritance ?
	Inheriting feature and behaviour of Parent class to Child class.

14. What is difference between '==' and 'is' ?
	'==' is a relational operator used to check equality of a vlaue. Compare the values of two objects.
	'is' is a key keyword used to check object reference location or two references point to the same object in memory. 

15. What is lambda function ? When to use filter,map,reduce ?
	It is a simplest form of representation of a anonymous function which takes any number of arguments and one exression
	filter is used to filter the results which contains elements belongs to true condition.
	map is used to get output value or entire results for expression. Returns an iterator of the results.
	reduce is used to reduce to the single valued output result. To reduce an iterable to a single value

16. What is main purpose of Python ?
	Readability, Ease of use, and developer productivity
	General-Purpose Programming
	Cross-Platform Compatibility
	Extensive Standard Library
	Rapid Prototyping and Development	
	Interpreted Language
	Integration and Extensibility

17. What is __init__(), __str__(), __repr__() ?
	__init__() called when an object is created, to initialize the object's attributes.
	 __str__() to return a human-readable string that provides useful information about the object.
	__repr__() to define a string representation of the object that is intended to be more unambiguous, and ideally, one 	           that could be used to recreate the object.
	__init__() is for initializing the object when it is created.
	__str__() is for providing a readable, user-friendly string representation of the object (often used with print()).
	__repr__() is for providing a more precise or detailed string representation, mainly used for debugging or logging 

18. What is Static method and class method ?
	Staticmethod: The method does not access or modify the state of the class or instance.
	Classmethod: The method takes the class itself as the first argument (usually cls), and can modify the class state.

19. Class variable and Instance variables ?
	Class variables: Shared across all instances of a class.
	Instance variables: Unique to each instance of the class.

20. How do you manage memory in Python?
	gc module handles memory by reclaiming unused memory, and objects are automatically deallocated when they are no 	longer referenced.

21. What are modules and packages ? Mention its uses and applications ?
	- modules : Python file that contains a collection of functions, classes, variables, and runnable code. 
	  modules Uses: Code Reusability, Organization, Maintainability
	  modules Applications: Math Operations, File Handling, Networking
	- package  : Collection of Python modules organized in directories. A package can contain sub-packages, modules, and 		  even other files such as data files or configuration files.
	  package Uses: Code Organization, Namespace Management, Scalability
	  package Applications: Web Development, Data Science, Machine Learning



22. What is Garbage collector ?
	It is process of automatically managing memory by deallocating objects that are no longer in use, thus freeing up 	memory for new objects.


23. What is Memory leak and how to handle them ?
	A memory leak occurs when a program consumes more and more memory over time without releasing it back to the system, 	even though the memory is no longer in use. 

24. what are Golbal varibles? Public, private, protected ?
	- A global variable is a variable that is declared outside of any function or class, typically at the top of the 		  program or script. This variable is accessible from anywhere in the code.
	- A public attribute or method can be accessed from anywhere — both within the class and outside the class.Accessible 	  from anywhere in the program.
	- A protected attribute or method is intended to be accessible within the class and by subclasses (derived classes). 	  It is not intended to be accessed directly outside the class.Accessible within the class and by subclasses. It 	  should not be accessed directly from outside the class. 
	- A private attribute or method is intended to be accessible only within the class in which it is defined. It should 		  not be accessed or modified outside of the class.Accessible only within the class. Should not be accessed directly 		  from outside the class.

25. What is difference between del and remove ?
	del statement is used to delete variables or entire items from a collection (such as lists, dictionaries, etc.).
	remove() method is used to remove the first occurrence of a specific value from a list.
	Use del: When you want to delete an element by its index or key or when you want to delete a variable entirely.
	Use remove(): When you want to remove a specific value from a list and you don’t know or don’t want to use the index 	of the item.

26. What is PEP8 and how it is useful ?
	PEP 8 (Python Enhancement Proposal 8) is the style guide for Python code. It provides a set of guidelines and best 	practices to improve the readability and consistency of Python code.
	Useful: Consistency, Readability
