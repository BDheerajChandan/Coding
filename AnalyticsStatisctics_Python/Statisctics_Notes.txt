Probability:
Random experiment - An experiment in which the outcome is not known certainity.
                    That is output of a random experiment cannot be predicted with certainity.
Sample space - Universal set that consists of all possible outcomes of an experiment and individual outcome are called elementary events.
Event - A subset of sample space and probability is usually calculated with respect to an event.
    ex: - Number of cancellation of orders
          Number of fraud credit cards transaction

3 types: Marginal, Joint and Conditional

Naive Bayes theorem :
- It is also known as binary classifier or probability classifier
- Widely used in text categorization
--> Supervised Algorithm
--> Bayes theorem
--> Native assumption (Occurence of features are independent)
Bayes theorem formula :
    P(A)
    P(B)
    P(A/B)= P(A and B)/P(B) ..(1)
    P(B/A)= P(A and B)/P(A) 
    P(A and B)= P(B/A).P(A).. in(1)
    so, P(A/B)= [P(B/A).P(A)] /P(B) .. Derived equation
