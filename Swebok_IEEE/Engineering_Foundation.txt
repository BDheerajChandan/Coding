CSDA is for GET(Trainee) and Entry level software professionals which bridge gap between education and real world experience.
Certified CSDA verifies fundamental of Software enginering principles.

Software Engineering Foundations :
Principles for discipline - Engineering includes Science + Math (Science=Techniques and tools for measuring, accessing, evaluation goals and managing projects).
Software engineering principles - emperical and experimental methodds, statistical analysis, hypothesis testing and validation, System development, engineering design principles, root cause analysis, the role of standards,modeling ,simulation and prototyping.
