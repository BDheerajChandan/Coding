									BIG DATA - Introduction 
========================================================================================================================================================================

- It is also called software utility. 
- Big Data refers to a technology designed to analyze, process, and extract information from large and complex datasets.
- It is a technology designed to analyze, process, and extract information from a large dataset and complex structure.
- Earlier data was manged by general programming languages and basic SQL and these were not enough to handle huge data so they introduced bigdata with hadoop which takes   care of all the client and large organization's requirements and needs.
- Along with BigData many other technologies like DL(Deep Learning), ML(Machine Learning), AI(Artificial Intelligence) and IoT(Internet of Things) that are massively in   use by professionals.

- Types of Big Data technologies :
	Big Data Technology is classified into two types -
		- Operational Big Data Technology : It includes basic day to day data that people uses it to get process.
